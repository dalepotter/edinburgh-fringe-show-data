# Edinburgh Fringe 2017 Show Data

Script to extract listing data on all shows at the Edinburgh Fringe 2017 as a CSV file.

This uses the unlisted API to first iterate over a paginated set of listings, and then export the data in CSV format.

This is designed for one-off use to perform a 'data dump' for personal use in planning the optimum fringe experience!


## Non-personal use

Please refer to the official Edinburgh Festivals [Fringe API](https://api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/documentation/fringe_approval) for use of data for end-user usage.  This requires approval from the Fringe authorities, particularly because many application developers will not have had experience with the particularities of Fringe ticketing and listings and therefore may not be sensitive to all the nuances of presenting and interpreting Fringe listings data in the way audiences expect.

In this instance, the quick hack was done since the data is being obtained for personal use only, and at my own risk.
